Below I provide more details as the whole file size in the system is limited to 5MB.

## About the paper ICEMI

Here I provided supplementary details for the accepted paper "Research on Intelligent Cardiopulmonary Sound Monitoring System Based on Wavelet Decomposition and Deep Learning" in ICEMI 2025.

+ Proof of Acceptance: Click [here](http://huyangjia.github.io/files/ICEMI接收证明.pdf)

+ Paper PDF version: Click [here](http://huyangjia.github.io/files/ICEMI20250077.pdf). 
  The paper has been accepted by ICEMI 2025, but the conference proceedings have not been published yet. As a result, there is currently no official online record, and the paper cannot be found through an online search, so I am unable to provide an official public access link at this moment.
